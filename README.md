### Agile's True Purpose: Fail Fast

**What is your understanding of agile methodologies?**

The true essence of agile software development isn't simply about being "agile" or adhering strictly to the Agile Manifesto. Rather, it's about the ability to respond rapidly to changing requirements. Countless companies have their own interpretations and formulations, often trying to mold Scrum Masters and other roles into their unique understanding of agility.

At its core, **the one reason** we practice agile methodologies can be distilled down to one key concept: **"fail fast."** We employ agile methods to identify, communicate, and respond to problems and challenges as quickly as possible, as articulated by Robert C. Martin. Or as the former CEO of Google put it, the key to success is to take high risks to fail fast.
